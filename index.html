BYOA is a fast growing trned that is revolutionizing the workplace. Because of the trend's growing popularity, IT is experiencing a serious slow down in it's control. Some famous BYOAs are used for email, file storage, and project/task managment. In addition because BYOA is a game changer, businesses are worried about the security of the company information. Before BYOA becomes more exposed, a brief background behind BYOA is important to know.</div>

However, the trend seemed to start as early as the 1980s. During this time, employees started bringing their spreadsheet application to help with challenging problems. And as years went on, BYOD has become a trend that soon lead to BYOA. BYOA began to shake up the workplace and business. People wanted to work and feel comfortable just as how they could do work from home.</p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">BYOA is significantly affecting worker productivity and changing the roles IT used to have. Studies, research, and surveys have been done and it has found that 70% of organizations have a BYOA atmosphere. But with all the workers bringing their devices, 54% of the comapnies have security issues. Even with the security issues and loss of control BYOA carries, this trend could be the reason for increased productivity, innovation, and better communication. IT used to make the decisions for anything software, but that changed. However, even if IT used to make all the decisions, organizations need to remember the importance of collaboration. And if the organization denies the benefits of this trend, organizations will miss out on the possible worker collaborations and increased productivity. BYOA is also breaking barriers for things that required traditonal methods of doing work. In addition, as businesses gorw and discover new trends, customers' preferences also change. Thus, the importance of byo (bring your own) comes to play on becoming more connected with people and work.</h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Multiple organizations are affected by this craze. Allowing personal applications to work, can scare the company with the fear of sensitive information spilling out, but this cannot be the reason for businesses to stop working all in all. Organizations of all sizes and of any kind can be faced with this problem. One type of business that could be faced with this is SMB. SMBs (small to medium) usually consists of 10-100 employees. According LogMeIn, 81% of SMBs are actively using a BYOA method of work. Another type of business that can also be affected by BYOA, are large corporations or companies. Large corporations or companies can deal with greater security risks and loss of data. One of the corporations affected by BYOA, is Telsyte. Telsyte is an Australian company that deals with advisory issues for the organization affected with the growth of technological trends and other technological issues. One corporation that is embracing BYOA and yet is challenged by it, is LogMeIn. LogMeIn is a business that consists of multiple IT managment solutions made to help businesses with challenges and changing needs.&nbsp;</h3>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Controlling BYOA remains to be a managment problem until a centralized system and better control of applications is enforced. In a study done by LogMeIn, 43% of IT is invovled with BYOA. 38% are only moderately invovled with it and 18% of IT choose not to be invovled at all. In addition to the study, 39% of employees also see no reason to seeks professional opinions from IT. Through another similar study, 80% of businesses buy their staff devices, but do not allow BYOA because of the dangers for third-party applications. Some of the popular third-party apps are Google and Dropbox. The IT department used to make the decisions before the craze started to gain more popularity. Some companies are also trying to limit and control or stop the consumerization of apps due to security reasons and leakages.</h3>

Some ogranizations today, have trouble accepting BYOA. But they need to know and understand the reality of the concept and how it is changing the way consumers and businesses work. Organizations today need to realize the opportunities BYOA brings. One of the biggest concerns with this trend however, is knowing the importance of controlling data leakage. Although controlling data leakage would depend on the type of company, it is important to research and have constant communication on how to keep information safe. The acceptable use policy (AUP) is another type of document that gives details and constraints, which a consumer agrees to. The AUP could be way to enforce better management because without the agreement, the consumer cannot access whichever network they have to be on.</p>

                                        <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Creating standards would not only help lessen the risks, but such documents would aid the questions raised by both users and businesses. These documents would also encourage teamwork, collaboration, communication, and thorough guidelines that will maintain and provoke responsibility to the user. In addition, guidelines and standards will force management to resort to consequences if a rule is broken. Collecting responses with the applications used promotes communication between IT and the employee. They could talk about the popularity of an application and what kind of content is being used and shown. This gives IT an opportunity to better meet the needs of businesses and employees. Controlling the management also means enforceing policies to those who could not comply to the rules. For BYOA, it is important for IT to remember that one of their roles is to help organizations and consumers the importance and dangers of third-party devices and applications. Both organizations and consumers would need to be aware of the importance of responsible consumerization and what they can do to benefit them and the organization. Managing identities would mean IT would have to focus on the access and authorizatioin issues of applications being brought into work. Creating a centralized password would be one example for managing identity. Sandboxing is another way to improve security. Sandboxing secludes an application that seems unsafe or protects an application so intruders, viruses, and other related will not interact with the secluded or protected app.</p>

The enterprise app store is a type of MDM because the content will only be made strictly to that business. The enterprise app store will also allow businesses to take control of what is being downloaded. Training employees on the impact of security breaches and acceptable devices for is critical for succeeding in BYOA. This will aid IT in the control of network. Controlling the network means discovering what device or application is being used. Because of the mass consumerization of apps, authentication technology is more important than ever. Authentication technology are tools and policies that create and meet special security expectations. One example of an authentication technology is the multifactor authentication. Multifactor creates different steps and ways to input information that could only confirm by the user who put in the answers to the different steps.</p>

Though, there are multiple approaches to conquering the movement of BYOA and embracing it; increased productivity, better collaboration, and project managemnt are benefits it provides. Because technology is increasingly growing, the advantages BYOA could bring new fresh ideas to brainstorming new trends, projects, and ways to collaborate with co-workers and get work done. However, coming across BYOA would all depend on what kind of business is running. How to tackle the security issues and its opportunities should also be taken into consideration. Today's IT/IS should embrace BYO because the trend looks like it is here to stay. New management styles and ways of doing tasks are some of teh beginning steps.</p>
